## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for taking a look at my profile! Below I describe some of the projects that you can find here.

### Highlighted Projects

[TEP-Net-V2](https://github.com/AbelHutten/TEP-Net-V2)  
- Experiments on improving [the current SOTA in rail vehicle ego path detection](https://github.com/irtrailenium/train-ego-path-detection). Added confidence scores, improved out-of-distribution errors when a leading vehicle is close, worked on adding memory to handle otherwise ambiguous cases.
- [Contributed `torch.compile` integration back to the original TEP-Net](https://github.com/irtrailenium/train-ego-path-detection/pull/5), reducing training time by 17.7% on RTX 4090, with potentially greater speedups on datacenter GPUs.

[Efficient-Real-Time-Detection](https://github.com/AbelHutten/Efficient-Real-Time-Detection)
- Experiments on using ideas from the literature on efficient transformers (e.g., GQA, Sparse Attention) in order to improve the SOTA in real-time object detection.

[AskePlaat-DRL-Solutions](https://github.com/AbelHutten/AskePlaat-DRL-Solutions)
- Solutions to most of the questions and many of the practical exersises in the textbook *Deep Reinforcent Learning* (2022) by Aske Plaat. Made as a reference for people working through these exercises. At the time of writing, the only one on the internet.
