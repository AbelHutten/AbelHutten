### Highlighted Projects
[Deformable Grouped Query Attention](https://github.com/AbelHutten/deformable-grouped-query-attention)
- Implemented deformable attention with grouped-query support. This is the first known instance of deformable attention enhanced with grouped-query attention, demonstrating a novel architectural combination for improved efficiency.

[TEP-Net-V2](https://github.com/AbelHutten/TEP-Net-V2)  
- Experiments on improving [TEP-Net](https://github.com/irtrailenium/train-ego-path-detection), the current SOTA in rail vehicle ego path detection. Added confidence scores, improved out-of-distribution errors when a leading vehicle is close, worked on adding memory to handle otherwise ambiguous cases.
- [Contributed `torch.compile` integration back to the original TEP-Net](https://github.com/irtrailenium/train-ego-path-detection/pull/5), reducing training time by 17.7% on RTX 4090, with potentially greater speedups on datacenter GPUs.

[AskePlaat-DRL-Solutions](https://github.com/AbelHutten/AskePlaat-DRL-Solutions)
- Solutions to most of the questions and many of the practical exersises in the textbook *Deep Reinforcent Learning* (2022) by Aske Plaat. Made as a reference for people working through these exercises. At the time of writing, the only one on the internet.
